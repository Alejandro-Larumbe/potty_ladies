It is a mild-mannered Achillea so is easy to manage in the garden.  Its flowers make a wonderful cut flower and they also dry particularly well.  It is very floriferous and flowers from late spring through to late summer and often beyond. Goldplate is easy care and particularly drought tolerant once established and its beautiful golden flowers look simply stunning with anything blue, so be sure to take a look at our lovely blue Asters.  The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) awarded this standout plant with the prestigious Award of Garden Merit.  Achilleas love sun and soil that is not too rich so your average garden soil is just to its liking, all it really wants is some good drainage',
